TSS calculations - inconsistencies,"Hello,
I have a question about how TSS is calculated as I have 2 sessions to show as examples where they seem very inconsistent.
The first ride is from Kristen Gadson on 29th Sept 2024, 1hr9m most of the time in Z1 (81%) and 18% in Z2, yet a TSS of 50, which seems very high.
https://app.trainingpeaks.com/#calendar/athletes/1834461


The second ride is one of mine on 23rd Aug 2024 where I spent 41% in Z1 and 55% in Z2, ride length 1hr7m TSS 44 which seems more accurate.
https://app.trainingpeaks.com/#calendar/athletes/652813

Please can you explain why Kristen's TSS is so high (she did say this ride was very easy).

Thanks!
Sarah

Hi Tony,

Thanks for the onboarding email and reaching out. Much appreciated.

I am all good from my end. I have used the premium athlete version for many years now so the coaching side of the platform is pretty self explanatory. I have just used the code this morning to waive the license fee and have gone with the basic $19/month package as I only have a handful of athletes I coach - Just enough to need them all in one place, but not enough for anything to fancy just yet. 

The ability to create plan and put them on the training peaks database for sale is a pretty neat feature which I will make use of. No expectations for sales but it is nice to have in the background on the off chance someone out there buys one.

If I need anything further I will let you know.

Have a great rest of the week and weekend ahead!

I put together a quick video for you with these 3 steps (https://www.loom.com/share/2e23c7cf26274596a4648b140901435a) that will help get you started.

Make sure you enter the TPCOACH code when purchasing your account to waive the $99 license fee (good until the end of the month).

Warm up standard for use in every trainingsession.,"HI,
I have a 15 min warm up session that I want to use in almost every session I do on the bike. I have saved the session in the library but how can I add the session to my synced workouts. I have tried where you can customize the specific session, but can¬¥t find a way to solve it.

It can be that way, that I need to manually add the warm up session details in every single session  ?...I was thinking about a easier why to incorporate my session from the library."

TrainingPeaks iOS App,"How frequently is TrainingPeaks updating the data in the calendar feed?

I changed the time of a training session. I subscribe to my calendar via iOS calendars. After one hour, the session time in my iOS calendar has not changed. I unsubscribed from the calendar and resubscribed, but the session time is still not matching the new time.

User story - my coach plans the training for a day, and the time appears in my calendar as 0:00.
In the morning I review my day and change the time in iOS app to match my availability. The initial time change syncs promptly to the iOS calendar. If my availability changes, I update the time in the iOS app, but the change is not getting updated in iOS calendar."

I am a performance nutritionist & work alongside athletes/coaches utilising TP. What id like to do as their nutritionist is add comments to their planned workouts to suggest pre/peri/post nutrition strategies to support their session. 

Would this require premium athlete accounts, or can I do that with basic athlete accounts? The athlete I assume would just add me as an additional coach.

Today‚Äôs 10mi time for example. Average for 10.28mi was 6:31/mi but shows a peak 10mi of 6:43/mi. Again not that it really matters but I was curious if there was a reason I am seeing this. Thank you.

Hi Gabriel,

I have a strange issue with a client. He is using his apple watch and the TP app to get the schedules and coaching. Somehow it doesn't work in the weekend days and than he send his info threw strava (but that is no good, less information and its not the way it should be) During monday-friday there is no issues, but the last 3 weekend days, he has issues. What could be the problem?

His name is Geert Jan Hovingh. 

Can you have a look and help me?

Hi Guido, 

When an athlete chooses to switch their TSS calculation to rTSS they will be given the option to make it their default setting. This message will appear as they try to complete the action. Keep in mind this is only for premium athletes and does not work for basic athletes. I have attached a screenshot showing how this looks. 

Hope this helped! Cheers,

Hi Gabriel,

I send you a question a while ago about the TSS. You answer me this: ""Within each workout you can open the quick view and toggle between the TSS types using the down arrow (view screen shot). As a runner you can choose to make rTSS the default value or hrTSS. Otherwise the system will default to power thresholds using TSS.""

Now, how a client can switch to rTSS modus constantly. Where they need to switch a button? 

Hope you can help me with this.

Guido, 

It looks like Laurens is running with a power meter, power pad, or power estimator. This is evident because each of their runs include power data. Because the workout files for Laurens include power data, the system is calculating TSS based on the power threshold set in their account settings. not based on their pace thresholds. Keep in mind that TSS can be calculated with different data channels and there are different types of TSS. Example;

TSS (uses power), rTSS (uses pace), sTSS (swim pace), hrTSS (heart rate). TSS* (manual entry). Training Stress Scores (TSS) Explained (https://help.trainingpeaks.com/hc/en-us/articles/204071944-Training-Stress-Scores-TSS-Explained?auth_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjo3OTIyNSwidXNlcl9pZCI6bnVsbCwidGlja2V0X2lkIjpudWxsLCJkZWZsZWN0aW9uX2lkIjoyMDQ1NzczNjc4MDgxMywiYXJ0aWNsZXMiOlsyMDQwNzE5NDQsMTE1MDAwOTc1MDMyLDIwNTIzMDEzMF0sInRva2VuIjpudWxsLCJleHAiOjE3MDAxNDA5NzB9.V4ITE9qGxm__2OBiBprj2PQ6PQfDm4wld8aV7BNuEGE)

Within each workout you can open the quick view and toggle between the TSS types using the down arrow (view screen shot). As a runner you can choose to make rTSS the default value or hrTSS. Otherwise the system will default to power thresholds using TSS. I've gone ahead and done this for Laurens most recent run on Tuesday the 17 of October, but to get more accurate rTSS for his workouts you will need to go back and do this for each of his workouts in the past. 

I also noticed that Laurens does not have any Sport Specific thresholds. Only the default thresholds are set. It is important to set sport specific thresholds for any athlete that is training for a specific sport. How To Set Thresholds And Calculate TrainingPeaks Zones (https://help.trainingpeaks.com/hc/en-us/articles/204073584-How-To-Set-Thresholds-And-Calculate-TrainingPeaks-Zones)

Hope this helped! Let me know if you have any more questions.

Hi Gabriel,

Untill now working with TP is really nice. There is one thing i dont understand why i cannot change it.

One customer scores to high on his metrics (TSS & IF), but the statistics I use say he's absolutely in the right zones for training. I think there's a parameter which gives this result (and not that the training is to heavy or intens)

Can you help me solve the problem?

Re: Your TrainingPeaks Renewal Didn‚Äôt Go Through,"Dear TrainingPeaks Support Team,

to be honest, I really can¬¥t believe what‚Äôs happening since almost a year now.
Almost every month you resp. your payment system says our card needs to be updated.
And every time we are telling you that this is simply not true. Then you are checking again and - o wonder - the payment goes through.
This is getting really annoying for me as your customer and it is not in line with what can be expected from professional company at all.

We have already asked you a couple of times to take care that not every month the same problem occurs again and again just because you are not able to tell your system that my card is updated.
I also have recently doublechecked with my bank that the fault is not on their side. The card is fully operational with a couple of other companies.

I really really kindly ask you one more time again to really check your payment system and IT-wise tell him that my card is fully updated and operational.

Thank you and kind regards,

Dr. Hans-Albert Birkner

Can I have a refund of the training plan?,"Hi, I would like if possible to request a refund on the last program I purchased. I have been a trainingpeaks customer for quite some time and will definitely continue to be. The program unfortunately, is not as I expected: the workouts are only described, and not created with trainingpeaks. This leads me to have to do everything by hand for each workout. I have started to do that, but it is too much work and one that I don't have time to do. I am not questioning the program, which will certainly be great, but how it is distributed. Trainingpeaks is an amazing platform, it would be good if programs were created by taking advantage of it, not just describing it. For this reason, I ask for a refund of the program and suggest, to indicate in the description of the program, that the workouts are not created but only described.

Questions strength 2,"Hi,

2. could you add a paramter 'rest between sets'? that would come in very handy for us :-)
3. sometimes we want to give a different number of reps on the left side than on the right side: could this also be a parameter?
4. another desired parameter is durantion/side

Thank you!!!!!!

Workouts not pairing,"Hello, I seem to have recurrent issues with workouts not pairing even though I change the type of workout to what is recommended by my coach, ie to the kettlebell for cross training. Then I go to the computer and it will still not pair when I try the pairing system overlay. What needs to happen to get the workouts to pair automatically and why doesn‚Äôt it pair when I ask it to? Thanks. "
"Re: Welcome to TrainingPeaks, Amber. Let‚Äôs Get Started","Hello,

I accidentally made a coach account instead of athlete. Can you either delete or convert into an athlete account?

Is there any way you can restore my old account, it's still under paid period (only paid two days ago) - or possibly migrate my old data to my new account? 

Anything before July 3rd 2024.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Me gustar√≠a si fuera posible quitar los entrenamientos programados pero sin eliminar el entrenamiento realizado por el deportista.

3.- Cuando cambio en mi configuraci√≥n el sistema de unidades metrico, me lo cambia a imperial.

please remove assistant coaches,"Hello,

I am writing about this coach account:

username: NordicSkiLab
email: tpmain@nordicskilab.com
First and Last name on the account: Kim McKenney

There are 2 assistant coaches under this account, named Annika Richardson and Scott Gow. Can you please remove these coaches from my account? 

It is important that you don't charge them going forward. If you are unable to convert them to a free coach account, please let them know so that they can delete these accounts. I've cc'd them with their personal emails. I believe the emails on their coach accounts are nordicskilab.com email addresses, but I'm not 100% sure.

Please let us all know (cc;d) when this is done and if we need to do anything else. You can remove the athletes under Scott's account from my account as well. If you need to confirm from this email address tpmain@nordicskilab.com, please just send an email and I will respond with a reply.

I hope that all makes sense. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Duplicating a Workout in Training Peaks,"Dear Training Peaks team,

I'm reaching out because I would like to copy and paste the exact programmed workout from my marathon on September 29, 2024 to repeat it again (exactly as it was programmed) on November 3, 2024 at the New York Marathon.

I will no longer be working with the coach, so I can't ask him to duplicate it and set it for me on November 3. 

Could you please help me understand how to do this easily so I don't have to rebuild the whole workout in Workout Builder?

Thank you very much.

In the meantime, Holly let me know when Mateus would be on his recovery weeks so I have made a note in my calendar regarding when these land so I can adjust on my end (we will de-load him in the gym and on speed days).

 

In the meantime I will look into getting a coach account with Training Peaks.

Can you tell me if it is possible to set Swim Speed/Pace in mins/100m? The default is mins/100y and that is confusing for nearly all my athletes. 
I saw a TrainingPeaks article recently where a coach was discussing setting swim zones and I could see an image of the zone setting page where the pace was in mins/100m so I guess it is possible! Thank you

If that is true, or something like that, can I reuse the training plan for another later race at no additional cost?

That is very strange, I'm not sure why it is doing that. I'm not seeing anything wrong on the plan.


Training Peaks, can you please look into Ben's workouts, he has had a handful of workouts that have ended early on his watch. I'm not seeing anything wrong on our training plan, could this be a bug on his watch?

Luke, I hate to bother you again but I'm having a problem with some of the workouts ending way too soon. It happened to me last week on a 35 minute endurance run that ended after 15 minutes. This morning it happened on my Fartlek run. After the 5th of my 6 intervals, I went from recovery to 6th interval to recovery to cooldown in a span of maybe 10-15 seconds. I'm wondering if this is an 80/20 issue or a TP issue.

Hey Ben,


Thank you for all the information. It is important to remember that the pace and HR numbers will not line up perfectly and as you can tell there can be so many other variables, the temperature, hills, how recovered you are, etc... It is good to take these numbers with a grain of salt. Give yourself some bigger zones if you terrain can vary a lot. For example, my plan that I follow is a pace plan, however I'm always checking my HR as well. I know my HR during easy runs should be in the 140s and my pace should be in the 9 minutes. So I give myself a good range, because I'm going to feel different everyday. I've also found that I really enjoy watching my HR on easy runs, but find it much easier to hit my paces on harder runs, it can be very hard to track HR on the speed days, because often times our HR is delayed on our watches. I hope this all helps, the goal of these plans is help you learn your zones and be able to make good judgement on each day to hit those workouts. After awhile you will know if you are running easy or if you pushed yourself in a speed workout.


Thank you.


Luke

Luke, having used 80/20 for a month or so, I really like it. There's one problem, though. Setting my zones has been very difficult. The talk test for heart rate  is so subjective. I've ranged from a threshold from 129 to 158. It seems to vary pretty wildly based on weather and how I'm feeling that day (lack of sleep, fatigue from previous runs, etc.). 158 is too fast. 129-133 is way too slow. In zone 1 at a 133 threshold, I'm at about a walking pace, or a little less. It's very difficult not to exceed the max, and it stresses my Achilles tendons to go that slow.  I finally settled in at 144, which seems perfect if I'm shooting for an RPE of about 3 in Zone 2. But on higher zones - in progression runs, for instance - there's no way I could run at SSP for 2 hrs., much less LTP at 1 hr. and CV at 30 min. I can run at those paces, but not for that long. Not even close, really. 

Additionally, I'd rather train by pace. Heart rate doesn't account for hills and I'm in a very hilly area so I typically have to slow to a crawl uphill to stay in a given zone. I switched to pace for this morning's run, but entering my last 5K time (26:54) gave me a pace that is significantly higher than I run in Zone 2 with a 144 heart rate threshold. In fact, on this morning's endurance run (5 min Zone followed by 35 minutes Zone 2) my heart rate was hovering between 138-144 for most of the run. I could probably run that pace for an hour or so, but not comfortably. It's certainly not a conversational pace. 

I'm wondering why there's such a large gap between the two. Like I said, training by heart rate at a threshold of 144 feels more ""right"" to me, except in the higher zones (above Zone 2). If I were to continue training by pace I wouldn't really be doing 80% of my training at low intensity. And I'd expect to get injured eventually. Running without injury or soreness is the primary reason for my interest in 80/20 training. 

I will go back training based on threshold heart rate if I don't have a choice. 144 seems to be my sweet spot for the lower zones. But I don't know how to handle those higher zones. And It kind of drives me crazy to always be exceeding the maximum on hills (or falling below it going downhill). I imagine I should just suck it up and try to keep my pace steady even if I exceed the zone parameters in those circumstances. But I really don't know for certain so I'd appreciate some clarity, as I intend to start training for a 5K in a couple weeks. 

Thanks

Ben

Thanks Luke, they did help me get re-synced. Hoping this won't be an ongoing issue. 

I'm enjoying the program I'm on now but it's probably a little too easy for me. I think I want to start a 12 week level 1 maintenance program. Then when I start training for a 5K in late August I can buy a Level 1 5K plan. Should I just buy via TP? Will I be able to set my start date/days off?

I will definitely consider a subscription if everything goes smoothly with the app and syncing but for now I'm going to go a la carte.

Yes, if you update your zones in TP it will apply the new zones to all the scheduled workouts.

Thanks Luke. I've been training on the free trial. I would like to extend that program. How would I do that?

I am experiencing a couple problems with syncing. My workouts were syncing fine to TP the first couple days, then stopped. All my workouts from the past week are checked on the TP app under ""Apple Watch and Health"" so I'm not sure what went wrong. I didn't change any settings. My workout today didn't even load onto my Apple Watch. I'm hoping I've solved the problem by disconnecting and reconnecting TP with my Workout app, which I just did. But if you have any tips, please pass them on. 

Also, if my talk test heart rate should change in the middle of a training program, am I able to change that in TP, and will everything else adjust automatically? I tried it the other day under settings: zones: heart rate and I noticed that none of the other values (max heart rate, resting, and zones) didn't change when I changed the threshold heart rate. And FWIW, I don't recall ever having entered a max or resting heart rate. I assumed it was set automatically based on the threshold rate I entered. 

I really like this training. When the syncing works, it's exactly what I was hoping it would be. But TP seems a bit buggy sometimes. I'm hoping I can work around that because I'd like to continue using 80/20. 

Thanks for your patience.

I'm not seeing you in our system as a subscriber, did you purchase a stand alone training plan. I'm happy to help you get it all set up and connected with your apple watch. It sounds like we need to get your zone set up in Training Peaks, so your training plan plan will pull the correct HR zones for each workout onto your watch. You do not need to memorize your zone/times before your run.

I've just purchased the training plan: 8 WEEKS TO FAST, FIT, & LEAN: Combined Workout and Nutrition Plan by Tim Cusick off trainingpeaks but would like it canceled and refunded please. The plan isn't at all what i expected it to be and has only 2 structured workouts each week (not the advertised 5) that can be synced with garmin or zwift. I thought it'd be like the first plan I bought from this coach's trainingpeaks library which I enjoyed so much.

Pls, can you issue a refund so I can get something else. The purchase was done today via paypal and this email address i'm mailing from is also my registered trainingpeaks address. Many thanks.

This only started happening this year, and I have tried to do everything. I always tell my athletes to click synchronise all past workouts when they sign up to TP, but it doesn't work. And unfortunately, some of them are not tech savvy enough to manually import all their past workouts. Could you help me resolving this issue?

Hello Sarah, 

 

This is interesting as the discount is valid. I looked at this athlete's account, and they recently used another discount code to purchase Premium.  The only restriction is that an athlete can not use the code twice in one calendar year. If anyone continues to have issues with this, I would direct them to our support team as they will be able to track this issue and be the quickest response for the member- support@trainingpeaks.com 

 

Sorry for the inconvenience this is causing.

Hello Sarah, 

 

I am sorry about this, as this seems to be becoming more and more frequent. I took a look at this account and it looks like they purchased Premium today and used another discount code. I am not sure if this is because the BT code was not working, but it will not allow them to purchase two subscriptions with two discount codes.  Really, the only regulation around the code usage is it can only be used once per user, and it will now allow them to stack discount codes.

Training Peaks calendar doesn't sync workouts with...,"Training Peaks calendar doesn't sync workouts with the Garmin calendar.
Hello.

I would appreciate some help because soo far I have spent around 3-4 hours solving this problem with no luck.

The Training Peaks calendar doesn't sync with my Garmin calendar. I receive all of my daily health matrices from Garmin on my TP calendar, but nothing the other way around.

Garmin and TP are connected and have all permissions from both sides. On my mobile app, TP still wants me to add a device for workouts, but when I add one, it says it's already connected to Garmin.

So the method I tried so far:

-disconnected and reconnected Garmin and TP via web app and mobile app. 5 times at least.

-syncing via Garmin Express (directly through cable)

-disconnecting and re-connecting my watch (Epix gen2 pro)

-restarting my phone and my watch

uploading TP calendar to Outlook calendar and then syncing with Garmin calendar via Office 365 account.

manually adding workouts in TP and Garmin calendar and then sending them to my device hoping that would trigger something but it didn't.

Inquiry Regarding Sold Plans and Payment on Training Peaks,"Dear TP,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to confirm that my plan is live, as I purchased it myself through my personal Training Peaks account. However, when I check the sold plans, it doesn‚Äôt appear. This raises a concern for me regarding the total number of plans I have sold.

Additionally, I would like to know how I can receive payment for these plans on the Training Peaks marketplace. Since I am based in Switzerland, I do not have a PayPal account. I would appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter without having to chase it through the usual channels, as I expect to receive my payment for the plan I purchased to verify its functionality.

Could you please provide an overview of the plans I have sold and any relevant information regarding payment?

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.

Best regards,

John Hendren

Hey Mark, 

If you're wanting to do a search for EF on longer rides, I'd suggest using the advanced search option and then filter by sport type and duration.

Hope this helps - let me know if you have any other questions.

<p dir=""auto"">First question, I had my only coached athlete do an FTP Test, got his new numbers, and went to update them as the email below says, however after going to the athlete profile, then to zones, I found I could not update his FTP, so I had him to do. Question, how do I update this number? The field was no modifiable by me.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Second question, I am now off the trial and purchased the Basic Coaching Level for $19/ month. This level is supposed to allow me to have 4 athletes at the Baxic Level and 1 Premium level. What am I getting a notification that my one Athlete must upgrade to the premium level or may get detached from me a coach? This does not make sense and would be very disruptive. Can you explain, correct etc. </p>

TSS Calculation Backfiller,"I have two run activities on 09/24 and 09/25 that have really high TSS scores. The elevation data was wrong, I went in and corrected it in both Garmin connect and TP. I then tried using the TSS backfiller tool to fix the high TSS and it didn't change anything. I know my zones are correct, and all the other data is fine so I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong at this point. "

Enrico Trevisan Coach,"Buongiorno, scrivo in merito ad una curiosit√†

Ho utilizzato il vostro sistema come Coach e per fare delle prove ho creato l'utente Enrico3v.trevisan collegato ad una mail enricoxxx@icloud.com

tutto ok, collegato alla piattaforma Garmin mi ha importato tutti i dati. 

Ho visto poi che la piattaforma offre un _Client che dovrebbe essere lo stesso tra coach e atleta (stesso utente) 
ho provato a collegare il garmin ma non mi passa nessun dato o solo pochi. 

Dove sbaglio ?? 
In riassunto vorrei utilizzare la piattaforma per un futuro coach ma sperimentare per me stesso. Mi pare di aver capito che la piattaforma coach include un atleta premium, _client. 
corretto??

I have problems with the following: Any edits made to the workout (moving to a different day, changing the structure or title) immediately sync to Garmin Connect. You will also need to sync your device with Garmin Connect for the changes to update on your device.

-> After doing this chances  in my todays training, I couldn¬¥t FIND the restructured training SESSION on my Garmin 530. UNDER THE SECTION ""TRAININGSPLAN"" ON MY GARMIN IS STILL THE OLD TRAINING AND NOT THE NEW. 

I can see this new training on my Garmin  app, so the sync from Trainingpeaks to Garmin app works, and from there I can download it into my Garmin, but as said there is still the old one and not the revised one on my Garmin?

Could you please help me?

Many Thanks
Gerhard

This morning I again cannot connect to my TP account from my iOS device. I first got a message that the App couldn't identify a server (something with TPAI (?) in the name (it flashed across my screen pretty fast).  Now when I try to login to my account on the App it says it cannot open an SSL socket and refuses to make the connection.

I guess the identity of your server, compared to the one on my phone, has changed and part of the SSL protocol is to identify the server it has been using to make sure my queries have not been redirected to a 3rd party server? I don't know how iOS stores server identities (if this happened on one of my other computers I would just delete the server ID and 'start over').

I attach the screen shot I am getting now when I try to connect from my iOS app.

On the weekend I also had trouble connecting from a Chrome browser on my computer. That seems to be working fine still this morning.

"Hello, first my problem. I can't get all the data ...","Hello, first my problem. I can't get all the data from my iPhone (training app) synced into the Trainingpeak app. I also use an Apple Watch (Series 5). I connected the Apple Watch Workout app and Apple Health (there's a check mark there). In the settings on the desktop computer it only shows my ‚ÄúForm App‚Äù in the settings. Nothing else. Unfortunately, it doesn't show all of the workouts from the last few months. He only loads a few into the calendar. Why is this and what do I have to do? I have already made updates on the iPhone/Apple Watch, uninstalled and reinstalled the Trainingpeak app and reset all devices. I would be grateful for an answer. Best regards, Thomas

Abonnement,"Dear Training-Peaks,
I made a mistake: I didnt know that i accepted an Abonnement for more then 1 Year.
I had TrainingPeaks from last year September to this year September, because i wanted to do an Ironman and i did it in August 18th. But i didnt cancel the Abo, so now i had to pay 149‚Ç¨ again, but i dont have the Money for that and im not using TrainingPeaks at all. It would be very nice, if you could send me the Money back because i really dont use it and i didnt know that i accepted an Abonnement for more then 1 year. Please, it would be really nice if you could send me the Money back. 
I had a Wonderfoul year with Trainingpeaks and im sure that i am using it again later in my life because i definetely want to to a seoond and a third longdistance Triathlon but not at the Moment, i have to Focus on my University.

I am really sorry about that vut i am really sad as well because at the Moment i dont have the Money for that.
